Lamp is an full stack Express/React application designed to help connect volunteers and their skills with non-profit organizations. Volunteers are able to search for organizations and send a request volunteering their time and services. Organizations receive these requests and are given the ability to accept/decline the request. Each volunteer and organization is authenticated through a JS web token, creating a personalized dashboard where they can perform their respective actions. Backend/database can be viewed here: https://github.com/jpswt/LAMP-Backend

Once a volunteer is signed up, they are able to search for organizations via google maps and an organization list. They can select the organization they would like to share their skills with and send them a request. The volunteer is able to track their requests by viewing them in request section of the dashboard. They can view the current status of the request to determine if it still pending, been accepted or declined.

Once an organization if signed up, they are able to view the incoming requests from volunteers and decide the appropriate actions for each request. Once the organization accepts/declines a request, they will automatically be moved to correct location. They can also monitor these requests through the dashboard.
